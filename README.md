# Using the SDK

The SDK has two clients, one for the [SaaS fulfillment API version 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2) (**MarketplaceSaaSClient**) and one for [metered billing APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/marketplace-metering-service-apis) (**MarketplaceMeteringClient**).

Both of them use the client credentials flow, service-to-service authentication for authenticating to call the APIs. The clients support both client secrets and X.509 certificates.After registering an single-tenant application on Azure AD, just create a client secret, or use a X.509 to call the constructor as follows:
``` csharp
    new MarketplaceSaaSClient(<tenantId>, <clientId>, <clientSecret>);
```

Then call the appropriate method corresponding to the API call.
``` csharp
    var page = await this.sut.FulfillmentOperations.ListSubscriptionsAsync();
```

Most of the code is generated, except an extension method

- ListAllSubscriptionsAsync - List all of the subscriptions, implementing pagination.

# Running the tests
The tests use the standard .NET core configuration system user secrets for configuration. Simply add user secrets for the following values, using your favorite method, i.e. either ["dotnet user-secrets"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=windows), Visual Studio Code extension, or Visual Studio 2019 user secrets menu option.

- TenantId
- ClientId
- clientSecret

One test requires a marketplace purchase identification token and you can get it from a landing page link generated from an actual subscription. Simply url-decode it, and set the value in the test.
